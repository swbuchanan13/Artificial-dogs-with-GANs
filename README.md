# Artificial-dogs-with-GANs
Develop a GAN network to create artificial images with dogs

## Data:

We will be using the Stanford Dogs Dataset, which was the same dataset that was used in the original Kaggle competition. The dataset contains 20,580 images of 120 different breeds of dogs from all around the world. The images and annotations of the images came from ImageNet.

## Techniques Overview:

As we are looking to create a Generative Adversarial Network of dogs, we will be creating a generative network as well as a discriminative network. Based on the research we have done, we plan to use a deconvolutional neural network for the generator and a convolutional neural network for the discriminator.

As an additional step, we hope to also create a model to perform image classification for the breed of dog shown in the picture. To solve this problem, we are also planning to use a convolutional neural network.
